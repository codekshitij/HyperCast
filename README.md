## AI-Driven Hyper-Local Weather PWA

This repository contains a phased implementation of a weather forecasting system that generates its own predictions without public weather APIs.

### Getting Started
- Phase 0 focuses on data acquisition and feasibility.
- Start by setting up Python for ingestion and API services.

### Repo Structure
- frontend/ — PWA (to be added)
- services/api/ — FastAPI backend
- services/ml/ — ML training/inference artifacts
- data/ingestion/ — data acquisition scripts
- infrastructure/ — IaC/K8s (later phases)

Refer to `Project_outline.md` for the full plan and roadmap.
